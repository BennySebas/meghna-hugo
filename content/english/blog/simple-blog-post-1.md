This project seeks to address the challenge of inadequate access to charging options in public spaces. In today's world, electronic
devices play a crucial role in our lives and with that, the limited battery life of these same devices becomes a significant obstacle to
our everyday activities. Users often find themselves in situations where their equipment runs out of power, and so, the demand for
accessible and convenient charging options is on the rise.

Our integrated charging solution benefits a diverse range of users and sectors providing convenient charging solutions for
everyday users and ensuring accessibility to power, especially in emergency situations.
I also allows event organizers and busiesses to enhance their customer experience by improving clients or attendees satisfaction by
providing reliable charging options.

> A powerbank for anyone at anytime so we can always keep connected to the world.

The existing public charging infrastructure faces limitations in terms of coverage and accessibility. Typically, charging stations are
stationary, forcing the users to stay next to them in order to charge anything Additionally, the cost and complexity of expanding the
current infrastructure can be substantial.

Our proposed solution is to integrate power banks into charging stations that ought to be deployed in high-traffic areas. This
innovative approach aims to provide a portable and convenient mean for users to charge their devices on the go. By combining the
reliability of conventional charging stations with the flexibility of portable power banks, we intend to enhance the overall public
charging infrastructure and meet the evolving needs of a technologically driven society.

On the other side, after acknowledging the potential constraints of implementing and maintaining this integrated system, we
commit on optimizing the effectiveness and durability of the product with corresponding focus on its affordability, comfort and
accessibility.
